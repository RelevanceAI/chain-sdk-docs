Getting started with Relevance AI is easy. You can get started in under 5 minutes using our SDK.

## 1. Install Relevance and authenticate

To get started, install our Javascript SDK and CLI. You can do this using `npm`:

```bash
$ npm install -g --save @relevanceai/chain
$ relevance login
```

The second command will redirect you to your browser, where you can sign up or log in. Follow the instructions to enter your region, project and API key into the CLI to authenticate the SDK.

## 2. Set up integrations

To take advantage of their LLMs, you'll need to configure integrations such as Open AI and Cohere. If you need to re-open your page for setting keys, simply run in your terminal:

```bash
$ relevance keys
```

## 3. Create a sample chain

Create a `/chains` folder in your project and create a file called `hello-world.ts` with the following contents:

```js
// chains/hello-world.ts
const chain = defineChain({
    title: 'Hello world!',
    params: {
        name: {
            type: 'string',
        },
    },
    setup({ params, step }) {
        const { name } = params;

        const { answer } = step('prompt_completion', {
            prompt: `Say hello to me! My name is: ${name}.`,
        });

        return { answer };
    },
});
```

To deploy this chain, run:

```bash
$ relevance deploy
```

This will output a preview URL to view the chain online in the Notebook or an ID that can be used to run the chain with the SDK.

## 4. Use the SDK to run the chain

In your web app, you can now call the chain using the SDK:

```js
import { Client } from '@relevance-ai/chain';

const client = new Client({ regionId, projectId });

const result = await client.runChain('hello-world', { name: 'Dan' });

// { answer: "Hey Dan, how are you?" }
console.log(result);
```
