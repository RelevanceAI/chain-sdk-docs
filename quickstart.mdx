Getting started with Relevance AI is easy. You can get started in under 5 minutes using our SDK.

## 1. Download and configure the Relevance CLI and SDK

You need to install our JS SDK to get started. You can do this using npm:

```bash
$ npm install --save @relevance-ai/sdk
$ relevance login
```

The second command will prompt you for an API key and redirect you to the web app. You will then need to sign up or log in and grab an API key to enter into the CLI.

## 2. Set up integrations

You need to configure integrations such as OpenAI and Cohere to use their LLMs. This is done in the web app [here](https://chain.relevanceai.com/api).

## 3. Create a sample chain

Create a `/chains` folder in your project and create a file called `hello-world.js` with the following contents:

```js

```

Spin up a development server which will watch the file for changes and deploy it.

```bash
$ relevance dev
```

This will output a preview URL to view the chain online in the Notebook or an ID that can be used with the SDK.

## 4. Use the SDK to call the chain

In your web app, you can now call the chain using the SDK:

```js
import { Client } from '@relevance-ai/sdk'

const client = new Client({ regionId, projectId });

const result = await client.runChain('hello-world', { name: 'World' });

console.log(result);
```
