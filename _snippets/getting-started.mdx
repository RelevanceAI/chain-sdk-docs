## Getting started

Let's start by creating our chains backend! Create a repository with a `chains` folder inside it. Our CLI will automatically deploy all chains we create in this folder.

Speaking of CLI, let's install it!

```bash
npm install -g @relevanceai/chain
```

Next, let's authenticate:

```bash
relevance login
```

After following the instructions, you'll be set up and ready to go! Make sure to also add your Open AI key.
