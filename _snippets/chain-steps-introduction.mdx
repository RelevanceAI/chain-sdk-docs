The meat and potatoes of any chain are the "steps". These are the transformations that will execute on running a chain. They run in our hosted Relevance AI run time.

We have a whole library of pre-built steps, which you can see [here](/reference/tranformation-steps)! We also also support more advanced use cases where you can self-host any code as a chain step! Speak to our team if this is you.
