Core to any chain is the inputs it receives from the user, or consuming application. For example, if you are building a chain that converts PDF to text and then summarises it, you will need to receive the PDF file as an input. Or if you're building a chain that answers a user's question, you will want to receive the user's question as an input.

Define these in your Relevance AI chain via the `params` option.

You define each step using [JSONSchema](https://cswr.github.io/JsonSchema/spec/basic_types/) typing. This gets validated both on **build time** via our SDK and Typescript, _as well as_ on **run time** via our API. This helps you create rock solid production ready features.

```ts
const chain = defineChain({
    params: {
        pdf_url: {
            type: 'string',
        },
        user_question: {
            type: 'string',
        },
        num_answers_to_generate: {
            type: 'number',
        },
    },
});
```

You are then able to retrieve these params in your `setup` function:

```ts
const chain = defineChain({
    params: {
        pdf_url: {
            type: 'string',
        },
        user_question: {
            type: 'string',
        },
        num_answers_to_generate: {
            type: 'number',
        },
    },
    setup({ params, step }) {
        const { pdf_url, user_questions, num_answers_to_generate } = params;

        const { text } = step('pdf_to_text', { pdf_url });
    },
});
```

All of your params will be typed, and warnings will be thrown if you try to use them in a transformation step inappopriately.
