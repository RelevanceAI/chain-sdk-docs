## Creating your chain file

To take advantage of our automatic deployment, we recommend creating chains as files inside a `chains` folder.

Let's create: `chains/pdf-qa.ts`.

## Creating a chain

Start by instantiating your chain with the `defineChain` method.

```js
import { defineChain } from '@relevanceai/chain';
const chain = defineChain({
    title: 'PDF Q&A',
});
```

## Define parameters

You can think of parameters like the inputs to an API endpoint. When you run this chain, you may want to pass in variables. They can (and should) be typed using [JSONSchema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html).

For example, if you are creating a chain that asks questions of PDF's, you will want to define a `question` parameter of type `string`. You'll want to use this question in your LLM completion step.

```js
const chain = defineChain({
    title: 'PDF Q&A',
    params: {
        question: {
            type: 'string',
        },
    },
});
```

## Define steps

Steps are the sequence of transformations that your chain will perform. You define your steps within the `setup` function, which receives your `params` and the `step` method.

The `step` method is used to define a step. It receives a transformation `id` as the first parameter, and an object of `params` as the second parameter. You can find all transformation options from the link in the sidebar.

```js
const chain = defineChain({
    title: 'PDF Q&A',
    params: {
        question: {
            type: 'string',
        },
    },
    setup({ params, steps }) {
        const { question } = params;

        const pdf_url = 'https://www.mypdf.com/doc.pdf';

        const { text } = step('pdf_to_text', {
            pdf_url,
        });

        const { chunks } = step('split_text', {
            method: 'tokens',
            num_tokens: 250,
            text,
        });

        const { results: search_results } = step('search_array', {
            array: chunks,
            query: question,
        });

        const { answer } = step('prompt_completion', {
            prompt: `${search_results}

Based off the above context answer the question below:

Question:
${question}

Answer:`,
        });

        return { answer };
    },
});
```

## Define output

Note that the `setup` function returns an object.

In the above example:

```js
return {
    answer,
};
```

This is the output of the chain. When you run this chain, only those variables will be returned (nested in an `output` key).

On run, these will be accessible at:

```js
{
    output: {
        answer: '...',
        pdf_url: '...'
    }
}
```

## Setting publiclyTriggerable

If you want to run your chain in client-side code, you should set it to be publicly triggerable.

```js
const chain = defineChain({
    title: 'PDF Q&A',
    publiclyTriggerable: true,
});
```

You can now run your chain in client-side code by referencing the chain ID (file name in `chains` folder).

```ts
import { Client } from '@relevance-ai/chain';

// we can import the type for the chain to get type safety (optional)
import type pdfQa from './chains/pdf-qa.ts';

const client = new Client({ regionId, projectId });

// run the chain by its ID
const output = await client.runChain<typeof pdfQa>('pdf-qa');
```
