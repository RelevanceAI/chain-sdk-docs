## The chains folder

Create all of your chains in a `chains` folder at the root of your project. Each chain should be a separate file and export your `chain` instance. The name of the file will be the ID of the chain.

For example, if you create a file called `chains/pdf-qa.ts`, the chain ID will be `pdf-qa`.

You use the ID for running the chain from your application.

```js
// in chains/hello-world.ts
const chain = defineChain({
    title: 'Hello world',
    setup({ step }) {
        const { answer } = step('prompt_completion', {
            prompt: 'Say hello world.',
        });

        return {
            answer,
        };
    },
});

export default chain;

// elsewhere, in your application
const { answer } = await chain.runChain('hello-world');
```

## Deployment

To deploy your chains, simply run `relevance deploy` in your terminal. This will deploy all chains exported in the `chains` folder. It's as simple as that! You can now run your chains from your application.
