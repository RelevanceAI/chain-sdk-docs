## The chains folder

Create all of your chains in a `chains` folder at the root of your project. Each chain should be a separate file and export your `chain` instance. The name of the file will be the ID of the chain.

For example, if you create a file called `chains/pdf-qa.ts`, the chain ID will be `pdf-qa`.

You use the ID for running the chain from your client side application.

```js
// in chains/hello-world.ts
const chain = defineChain({
    title: 'Hello world',
    setup({ step }) {
        const { answer } = step('prompt_completion', {
            prompt: 'Say hello world.',
        });

        return {
            answer,
        };
    },
});

export default chain;

// in your frontend
const { answer } = await chain.runChain('hello-world');
```

## Deployment

To deploy your chains, simply run `relevance deploy` in your terminal. This will deploy all chains exported in the `chains` folder. It's as simple as that! You can now run your chains from your application.

## Server vs. client side Deployment

When running your chain on the server, all you have to do is import your chain file. You will have complete type safety.

```js
import helloWorld from './chains/hello-world.ts';
const { output } = await HelloWorld.run();
```

However, if running the SDK on the client-side, you will likely want to set your chain to `publiclyTriggerable` and use the `runChain` method. This will protect the internals of the chain from client side access.

In your chain definition, add:

```js
const chain = defineChain({
    title: 'Hello world',
    publiclyTriggerable: true,
    setup({ step }) {
        const { answer } = step('prompt_completion', {
            prompt: 'Say hello world.',
        });

        return {
            answer,
        };
    },
});
```

And now in your frontend code:

```ts
import { Client } from '@relevance-ai/chain';

// we can import the type for the chain to get type safety (optional)
import type helloWorld from './chains/hello-world.ts';

const client = new Client({ regionId, projectId });

// run the chain by its ID
const output = await client.runChain<typeof helloWorld>('hello-world');
```
