Relevance AI provides a low-code UI for building LLM chains and automations. The UI is called the Notebook. The Notebook is a web-based application that runs in your browser. It is available at [https://chain.relevanceai.com](https://chain.relevanceai.com).

## Getting started

The Notebook consists of four tabs:
1. App
2. Chain
3. Deploy
4. Logs

### App

The App is an interface for your LLM chains that lets you run and test them. Your inputs defined in the chain will be visible as a form and the output will be presented in our viewer which supports Markdown, HTML and Media.

### Chain

The chain is where you build your LLM chains. You can select from a library of transformations and add them as steps in the chain. You can also define the inputs expected of the chain, for example, a file input and a text input.

Each step in the chain can be ran individually in the Notebook. This is useful for testing and debugging your chain.

### Deploy

The Deploy tab is where you can deploy your chain to the Relevance AI cloud. Once deployed, you can run your chain from the Relevance AI API or a shareable URL.

### Logs

The Logs tab is where you can view the logs of your chain. This is useful for seeing your executions.
