We believe that LLM powered features will change how software is made. With Relevance AI, using prompts is extremely easy.

Simply use our `prompt_completion` transformation step. It receives a `prompt` param, and returns an `answer`.

```ts
// in your setup function
const { answer } = step('prompt_completion', {
    prompt: 'What is the best way to make a pizza?',
});

return {
    answer,
};
```

There are a few ways you can power up your prompts with Relevance AI: `model`, `system_prompt` and `quality_control` being the most powerful.
