- ### Fully-managed service

  Relevance AI is a fully-managed service that allows you to build and deploy LLM chains in minutes. You can use the platform to build and deploy chains without worrying about infrastructure, scaling, or maintenance.

- ### Multi-provider support
  
  Relevance AI supports multiple LLM providers, allowing you to quickly switch between any. Integrate once, use anywhere.

- ### Built-in vector store + integrations

  Relevance AI comes with a built-in [vector store](https://vectordatabase.com) that allows you to store and retrieve vectors for any text. Or, use our integrations to BYO database.

- ### LLM reliability

  Relevance AI provides a reliable LLM experience by handling all the complexities of LLMs for you. This includes things like quality control, schemas, context management, tokenization, and more.


## Common use-cases

Advanced use-cases leveraging LLMs can be built by using chains. These are some of the common ones we see companies get started with. However, what they create after that is as varied and impressive as the product teams building them.
